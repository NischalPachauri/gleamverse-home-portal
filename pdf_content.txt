The Public Library project aims to prvide essential educational and entertainment resources, supporting
website  displays essential user information such as the profile photo, username, bio, followers, following 
economic development and ensuring the equitable access to information for everyone needed. The
 count, total repositories, and star count. It also visualizes the user’s most used programming languages 
through a graphical represen tation, offering insights into the developer’s technical strengths. Repository
details including name, description, creation date, star count, and primary language are listed in 
an organized grid format.
 
Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub AP I integrations, Gleamverse(our website)
emphasizes responsive design, real-time data fetching, and seamless user experience. The project enhances
understanding of API - driven development, UI/UX design, asynchronous programming, and data
visualization. Gleamverse can be extended into a professional developer analytics platform.
 
 
  
 
                                                             Introduction 
 
GitHub is widely recognized as one of the most essential platforms for developers, hosting millions of 
repositories and serving as the backbone of modern software development. With the incr easing use of 
GitHub for showcasing portfolios, tracking progress, and contributing to open -source projects, there is a 
growing need for tools that simplify exploring developer profiles. GitView is designed to address this need.  
GitView is a real -time GitHub profile viewer that fetches and displays detailed information from any public 
GitHub account. The application offers an elegant interface where users can simply enter a GitHub 
username to retrieve all relevant information instantly. It caters to student s, developers, and hiring 
professionals who wish to analyze a user’s coding activity, repository distribution, and programming 
language usage. 
The motivation behind this project was to build a practical application that enhances understanding of web 
APIs a nd interactive user interfaces. By integrating GitHub’s REST API, GitView demonstrates real -time 
data handling and asynchronous programming techniques. It also uses chart visualization to convert raw 
data into meaningful insights. 
This project not only ser ves as a learning experience but also provides a useful tool for quickly browsing 
GitHub profiles. Its extendable foundation allows future upgrades such as commit history analysis, follower 
graphs, or deployment analytics.  
  
                                        Problem Statement and Description  
 
GitHub profiles offer a vast amount of information, but viewing them directly on GitHub can be 
overwhelming due to scattered data, multiple navigation steps, and limited visual summaries. Recruiters or 
students often need a quick, single-page overview that summarizes a developer’s skills, repositories, and 
activity. 
Problem: 
 
Users need a simple platform that provides:  
✔ Quick lookup of GitHub user details  
✔ Clear visualization of programming languages  
✔ Organized display of repository content  
✔ Real-time data without logging into GitHub  
Description: 
 
GitView solves this by allowing users to:  
 
• Search by GitHub username  
• Get instant details of user profile  
• View repositories in a visually structured la yout 
• Check total followers, following, and stars  
• Analyze most used languages through a chart  
The system simplifies the exploration experience by presenting data in an intuitive, minimal, and user -
friendly manner.

                                             Conclusion 
 
The project GitView – A Real -Time GitHub Explorer  successfully demonstrates the integration of 
modern web technologies with external APIs to create a responsive, interactive, and user -friendly 
application. The system provides a centralized platform where users can search for any public GitHub 
profile and instantly view detailed information such as repositories, followers, following, star counts, and 
language usage statistics. By utilizing the GitHub R EST API, the application ensures that all data displayed 
is accurate, up-to-date, and reflective of the user’s real -time GitHub activity. 
Throughout the development of GitView, key concepts such as asynchronous JavaScript, API fetching, 
JSON handling, DOM manipulation, and responsive web design were thoroughly explored and 
implemented. The project strengthened practical understanding of frontend development using HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript, while also emphasizing the importance of well -structured UI/UX desig n to enhance user 
experience. The use of graphical visualization for language distribution further showcased how raw data can 
be transformed into meaningful insights.  
The testing and evaluation phase revealed that the application performs efficiently acros s different devices 
and network conditions, maintaining speed, responsiveness, and stability. The system effectively handles 
errors such as invalid usernames, API failures, and missing data fields, ensuring robustness and reliability.  
Overall, GitView meet s all the objectives outlined at the beginning of the project. It provides a clean, 
functional, and easy -to-use interface for exploring GitHub user activity. Beyond academic requirements, 
GitView has practical potential as a lightweight tool for students, developers, and recruiters who need a 
quick overview of a developer's GitHub profile.  
 
Future Scope 
Although GitView is fully functional in its current form, there is significant potential for enhancement. 
Possible future improvements include:  
 Adding a contribution graph to visualize daily coding activity  
 Implementing repository sorting and filtering (by language, stars, date)  
 Introducing dark and light theme modes  
 Incorporating commit history and analytics  
 Adding caching to reduce API calls and improve pe rformance 
 Providing downloadable PDF reports for GitHub profiles  
With these enhancements, GitView can evolve into a comprehensive GitHub analytics platform offering 
deeper insights and advanced developer metrics.
