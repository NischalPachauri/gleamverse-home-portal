## Book Cover Naming Convention and Path Structure

- **Standard Path Format**: All book covers should use the relative path format `/BookCoversNew/[cover_filename].[extension]`
- **Naming Convention**: Cover filenames should match book titles with standardized formatting:
  - Lowercase or title case is acceptable
  - Special characters may be replaced with spaces
  - File extensions can be .jpg, .jpeg, .png
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If a cover image is missing, the system will use `/placeholder.svg`

## Validation and Error Handling

- **Validation Check**: The system validates all book cover links to ensure:
  - All paths are relative (starting with `/BookCoversNew/`)
  - Cover files actually exist in the specified location
  - No books are using placeholder images unnecessarily
- **Fallback Mechanism**: 
  - When a cover image is missing, the system automatically falls back to `/placeholder.svg`
  - Error logging is implemented to track missing covers in the console
  - The fallback occurs in these scenarios:
    1. No mapping exists for the book title
    2. The mapped cover file doesn't exist
    3. An error occurs during the cover retrieval process
- **Backward Compatibility**: 
  - All existing book records continue to work with the updated mapping
  - The enhanced `getBookCover` function maintains the same interface
  - Error handling is non-blocking and won't affect application functionality
